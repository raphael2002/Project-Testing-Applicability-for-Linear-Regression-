# Project-Testing-Applicability-for-Linear-Regression-using machine learning algorithms
The popular TV show "Sole Survivor" drops participants alone into remote areas to test their survival skills. They are then given ratings based on areas such as physical fitness, mental toughness. This project is to check whether the survival experts did a good job with their initial ratings.
Finally, performed linear regression on next season's participants and predicted their survival scores. Predicted the top 3 participants most likely to win next season and their predicted scores.
